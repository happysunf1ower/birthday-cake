**Follow the steps below for an amazing birthday cake!**

*FOR THE CAKE*
1. Preheat the oven to about 350 degress farenheit
2. Using some oil, grease 2, 8-inch round cake pans. Then, flour the pans with some flour and set them aside for later. 
3. In a medium sized bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt. Put that aside for the next step.
4. In an another bowl, beat together the sugar and the butter. You can use an electric mixer, or do it by hand. WHn the mixture becomes light and fluffy, add the eggs one at a time. Once the eggs are in, add the vanila extract.
5. Add the dry mixture of flour (that you made in step 3) to the butter (you made in step 4) while alternating with the milk.
6. Ensure that all ingredients are in and are mixed well. Then, divide the batter into the 2 cake pans. 
7. Bake the cakes in the oven whle its still preheating (this will ensure that the cake gets baked from the bottom as well). Take a toothpick and stick it in the middl of the cake. If it comes out dry and crumbly, your cake is ready! If not, let it bake for some more time. 
8. Once baked, let the cakes cool at room tempreture for half an hour. Then, take the cakes out of the pans and let them cool in the fridge for about 45-60 minutes. 

*FOR THE FROSTING*
1.  Beat the butter with an electric mixer, or by hand, until it is pale and fluffy (this may take 5-7 minutes)
2. Gradually add the the powdered sugar and salt and beat the mixture until its smooth
3. Then, add the vanilla extract and the heavy cream untill the frosting is smooth and spreadable

*DECORATION*
1. Take some of the frosting and spread it on the top of one of the cakes and put th other cake on top. If you like fruit in your cake, add the fruit before you put the 2nd cake on top.
2. Using a cake knife, spread frosting all over the cake and use a scraper tool to attain smooth edges
3. Last but not least, add the sprinkles on top!
